# TeamCombinator
Small vanilla js app to generate 4 players' combinations for kicker (foosball) matches.
* Algorithm selects players with less total games played
* Algorithm puts players on positions (goalee or forward) where they played less, randomly breaking ties
* Algorithm selects balanced teams: less experienced goalee would play with more experienced forward
